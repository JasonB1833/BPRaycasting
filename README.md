Boiler Plate Raycasting model, built primarily for learning purposes.

- run/built in visual studio

- currently renders the map/player view point properly but only outputs 360 ppm files without animating fully yet. (OpenGL? / SDL? / imgui?)

- todo: Added function and implementation to texture the walls properly, compile/runs but fails to load wall textures
